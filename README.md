# Flexigon
**How did it start+live demo:**
--------------
I started flexigon project when we held a maker party in Northern Saskatchewan: https://events.webmaker.org/events/7010

Then I decided to prepare a worksheet for it to guide them step by step. We use Mozilla x-ray goggles to let the student replace the images in flexigon pattern with their personal photos. Worksheet: http://smansoury.github.io/Flexigon/
