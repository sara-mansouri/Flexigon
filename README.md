# Flexagon
We are making flexagon patterns using our own photos. Flexagons are fun paper toys or according to Wikipedia "They are flat models, constructed by folding strips of paper, that can be flexed or folded in certain ways to reveal faces besides the two that were originally on the back and front." If you like geometry, html, and paper crafts(!) you will love it!

**How did it start+live demo:**
--------------
I started flexagon project when we held a maker party in Northern Saskatchewan: https://events.webmaker.org/events/7010

Then I decided to prepare a worksheet for it to guide them step by step. We use Mozilla x-ray goggles to let the student replace the images in flexagon pattern with their personal photos. Worksheet: http://smansoury.github.io/Flexigon/
