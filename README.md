# Flexigon
**How did it start+live demo:**
--------------
I started flexigon projecte when we held a maker party in Northen saskatchewan: https://events.webmaker.org/events/7010

Then I decided to prepare a worksheet for it to guide them step by step. We use Mozilla x-ray goggles to let the student replace the images in flexigon pattern with their personal photos.
